Working at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology, our goal is to advance our mechanistic understanding of neural information processing in the human brain by studying the neurological patients using a multimodal combination of advanced non-invasive methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and neuropharmacological interventions. Our main interest lies in exploring the immense potential of the human brain to compensate lesions (e.g. due to stroke) by reorganizing its functional network architecture. Based on this emerging understanding, we are beginning to design interventions (e.g. using non-invasive brain stimulation) to modulate neural plasticity aiming at amplifying functional recovery. To further elucidate lesion-induced neural plasticity, we explore how motor learning and changes in decision-making contribute and interact with such cerebral reorganization both in healthy subjects and acute stroke patients. This interest in combining our understanding the neural basis of cognitive function and the quest to advance clinical applications based on such mechanisms is complemented by an interest in how patient populations such as split-brain patients we help can understand human consciousness from a neural perspective.
